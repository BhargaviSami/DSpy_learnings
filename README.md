# DSpy Learnings

Welcome to the **DSpy Learnings** repository!

## About DSpy

**DSpy** is a powerful framework designed for prompt engineering and orchestration with Large Language Models (LLMs). It enables developers and researchers to build, analyze, and optimize prompts and workflows for LLMs in a systematic way. With DSpy, you can:

- Rapidly prototype LLM-based applications and agents.
- Experiment with different prompt strategies and compositions.
- Track and compare the performance of various prompt setups.
- Integrate with popular LLM providers and APIs.

## Repository Purpose

This repository contains my personal learnings, experiments, and notes as I explore DSpy's features and capabilities. It may include:

- Sample code and scripts demonstrating DSpy usage.
- Notes on best practices and tips.
- Example projects and workflows.
- Observations and findings from hands-on experimentation.

## Getting Started
